# deeplearning
repo for deep learning project code
1- dlfa_grp4_visionxformercomparison_vpw_1.py  contains code which we initially coded to train existing VIT,SWIN & DEIT model on ImagenetMini. Due to amount of time it took for these we could not run experiments while trainiing.

2- analysis_functions.py and dash_analysis.py contains code where used existing trained model from hugginggface and saw the impact on prediction with various image imputations.
